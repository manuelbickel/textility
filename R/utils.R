  # #GENERAL LOGIC--------------------------------------------------------
  #   #STEPS PPREP_1 to PREP_3 have to be performed separately from this function
  #   #PREP_1 get top N words per topic
  #   #PREP_2 reduce dtm to top N word space
  #   #PREP_3 create tcm with document co-occurence of top N words (binarize dtm, do cross product)
  #   #(PREP_3b - divide tcm by ndocs_tcm gives probability, since some Coherence measures, e.g., UMass originally use counts,
  #   #      the division is done at later step)
  #
  #   #calculate coherence for each topic (following steps 4.x are done individually for each topic)
  #   #1 reduce tcm to top n word space
  #   #2 create pairs of tcm reference indices of wi / wj to be used for coherence calculation
  #   #3 get values for all wiwj pairs from tcm and calculate score for each pair given a calculation rule specfied by particular coherence measure
  #   #     e.g. pmi = function(wi, wj, ndocs_tcm, tcm)  {log2((tcm[wi,wj]/ndocs_tcm) + 1e-12) - log2(tcm[wi,wi]/ndocs_tcm) - log2(tcm[wj,wj]/ndocs_tcm)}
  #   #4 aggregate the results via mean over number of wiwj pairs (and if desired aggreagte over all topics)
  #
  #   #TODO
  #   #(ii) use word vectors for wi / wj instead of single words, hence, subsets such as S_one_any, etc.
  #   #     creating, e.g., one any subsets requires to store one index against a list of indices, hence, formulas need
  #   #     adaption, e.g., something like tcm[unlist(wi), unlist(wj)] might work
  #   #(iii)Currently indices of subsets are stored in memory, this might be turned to dynamic creation of indices to spare memory usage
  #   #     the lines topic_coherence[,tcm_idxs := split(match... would have to be incorporated into create_wiwj_set
