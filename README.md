# textility
Collection of miscellaneous text utilities (helper, auxiliary, etc. functions) for text processing or text mining. Mainly wrapper functions that have emerged from my personal use that are based on already established packages.

Dependencies, etc. are not declared very well at the moment (depending on the use case the packages `text2vec`, `Matrix` as well as `slam`, `topicmodels`, `stm`, or `koRpus` should be installed) . Will be updated.
