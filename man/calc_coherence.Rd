\title{Calculation of various coherence measures for topic models}
\usage{
calc_coherence(top_term_matrix, tcm, ndocs_tcm = NULL,
  log_smooth_constant = 1e-13, average_over_topics = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{top_term_matrix}{A character matrix with the top words (entries = words) ranked starting with row 1 per topic (columnnames = topics). e.g.,
For example, the output of \code{topicmodels::terms(fitted_model, ...)}  text2vec::fitted_model$get_top_words(...).}

\item{tcm}{A term co-occurrence matrix that serves as reference to calculate coherence scores for the terms in \code{top_term_matrix}.}

\item{ndocs_tcm}{The number of documents that served to create the \code{tcm}.}

\item{log_smooth_constant}{Smoothing constant to avoid logarithm of zero in calcualtions, for example, \code{log(log_smooth_constant + 0)}.
By default \code{.1e-12} as used by RÃ¶der et al.(palmetto).
Use \code{1} to calaculate original UMass logratio as used by Mimno.
Use \code{.01} to calaculate original logratio as used in stm package.}

\item{average_over_topics}{By default \code{FALSE} to return coherence score for each indivual topic.
When set to \code{TRUE} return shows the mean score over all topics.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} showing the various coherence scores per topic (or average over all topics).
